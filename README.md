# LLM-Project
 
As a marketing director, I track data on a weekly basis so I can understand the performance of my campaigns. 

However, my CEO likes to look at things on a monthly basis since week to week there are sometimes fluctuations. 

Normally, he has to ask me to pull the data and I have to do that manually. 
 
But now, I've built a custom trained LLM that can take his questions, turn them into SQL queries, and report back.
